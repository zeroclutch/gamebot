    "rules": "Texas Hold'em rules. Each round, players are dealt two cards in their hands. Players can then choose to bet, fold, or raise. If a player folds, they are out of the round. If a player raises or bets, they must put more chips into the betting pool (or \"pot\") than the previous player did. If a player calls, they must bet the same amount as the previous player. Once the betting is over, three community cards are revealed. These cards are shared between all players. Then, a new betting round begins, and another community card is revealed. This repeats until all five community cards are on the table. Whoever has the best hand (best five cards) wins the pot! See the hand values at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em#Hand_values.",
