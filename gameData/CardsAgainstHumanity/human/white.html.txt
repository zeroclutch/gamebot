A pointless job at a soulless corporation.
Being terrified of a single bee.
Being young and in love in New York City.
Chemotherapy.
Delighting in the pain of others.
Forming a monogamous pairbond.
Getting my butt trapped hilariously in a tuba.
Getting sad for no reason.
Good ol’ fashioned face-to-face conversation.
Harnessing the power of steam!!!
How good this cantaloupe feels on my penis.
Just hangin’ out, ya know?
Like 50 mosquito bites.
Losing a loved one to Fox News.
Really tall people.
Saying “what’s that?” And then stealing a french fry.
Sucking all the oil out of the planet and fucking off to Mars.
The bomb strapped to my chest.
The joy of song.
The salmon.
The unspeakable horrors of factory farming.
The whole Jeffrey Epstein thing.
This horrible thing called twitter.
Three hours of pimple-popping videos.
Unwelcome sexual attention from grown men.
Using words to communicate.
War with China.
Watching the life drain from the eyes of my son’s killer.
