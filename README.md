# Current Game List
## 1. Cards Against Humanity
### *A party game for horrible people.*
Each round, a black card is selected, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card. Your white cards will be DMed to you, and you will select one. One player is selected to be the Card Czar each round, and they give a point to the player with the funniest white card.

## 2. Anagrams
### *Unscramble words in a frenzy against your friends.*
Everyone is given a set of letters, and score points by making words. Whoever makes the most words in 60 seconds is the winner! Longer words get more points, and duplicates aren't allowed.

## 3. Connect 4
### *Classic Connect 4, but with a whole lot more.*
Players take turns dropping one colored disc into a game board, which falls to the bottom. Whoever gets four in a row diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins! Try playing with more than 2 people, or playing the Connect 3 or Connect 5 variants.

## 4. Chess
### *Play the 500-year-old classic on Discord.*
Be the first to checkmate the opponent's king.  To view the full rules, see [this article on Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess). Gamebot has tons of board styles and piece styles to choose from. Customize your game however you like it!

## 5. Survey Says
### *The wacky game that tells you just how weird people are.*
We surveyed over 450 people on Reddit. You have to guess what percentage of them answered 'yes' to our questions. Every round, one player guesses a percentage, and everyone else has to figure out whether the real value is higher or lower.

## 6. Wisecracks
### *Make the wittiest responses to the silliest prompts.*
Two players are randomly chosen to face off, and have to submit answers to a given prompt. The rest of the players vote on their favorite, and the winner gets a point. First to a configurable number of points wins.
